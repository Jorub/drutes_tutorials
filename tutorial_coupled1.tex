\section{Coupled water and heat flow}
\subsection{Goal and Complexity}
\subsection*{Complexity: Medium}

\subsection*{Prerequisites: Heat and Water Flow} 

The goal of this tutorial is to get familiar with the idea of coupled models in 1D. For this we couple the $DRUtES$ standard Richards equation module and the heat module. We apply solar radiation data and rain and evaporation data as input.

\end{figure}

In the real world many coupled processes occur. In our model, heat conduction is dependent on the water flow as it transports the heat in the soil. 
In reality, heat and water is even more closely coupled as soil hydraulic properties are also dependent on temperature, e.g. surface tension and density change with temperature.  

In this tutorial three configuration files will be modified step by step. All configuration files are located in the folder \emph{drutes.conf} and respective subfolders. \begin{enumerate}
\item For selection of the module, dimension and time information we require \emph{global.conf}.  \emph{global.conf} is located in \emph{drutes.conf / global.conf}. 
\item To define the mesh or spatial discretization in 1D,  we require \emph{drumesh1D.conf}. \emph{drumesh1D.conf} is located in \emph{drutes.conf / mesh / drumesh1D.conf}. 
\item To define the radiation and cooling, we require \emph{heat.conf}. \emph{heat.conf} is located in \emph{drutes.conf /heat/ heat.conf}. 
\item To define the precipitation and evaporation, we require \emph{matrix.conf}. \emph{matrix.conf} is located in \emph{drutes.conf /water.conf/ matrix.conf}. 
\end{enumerate}
$DRUtES$ works with configuration input file with the file extension .conf. Blank lines and lines starting with \# are ignored. The input mentioned in this tutorial therefore needs to be placed one line below the mentioned keyword, unless stated otherwise.

\subsection{Scenarios}

For these coupled scenarios we need to define four boundary conditions, two for the heat flow and two for the water flow. We assume simplifying conditions for the bottom boundary. We assume the groundwater table to be at the bottom boundary. This condition does not change over time. Therefore we assign a constant Dirichlet condition for the water flow. We also assume that the temperature of the groundwater remains constant for the given simulation time. This means that we know the temperature, the solution of the heat flow equation and therefore assign a Dirichlet condition for the heat flow. 

In the following scenarios, the water flow is determined by evaporation and precipitation, or more generally time-varying rates of water, therefore the top boundary for the water flow is a Neumann condition. The heat flow over the top boundary is determined by radiation by the sun during the day and radiative cooling during the night. This condition can be understood as a Neumann condition. In these scenarios we want to investigate patterns of temperature oscillations.

We use time-varying boundary conditions for the heat and water flow, which need to be read from files. The file meteo\_heat.bc needs to be renamed to 102.bc in the heat folder. The file meteo\_water.bc needs to be renamed to 102.bc in the water.conf folder.

The material properties needed for scenarios are in Tab. \ref{tab_coup1}.

\end{enumerate}


\section*{Tasks}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe the temperature and water content distribution.
\end{enumerate}



\section*{Results}

The water content at the top follows the flux input. The lower the observation point, the less fluctuations can be observed.
The temperature follows the heat flux input. The temperature fluctuations become smaller with depth, but also show a lag time.
