\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Expectations}

This document is a collection of tutorials with the Dual Richards Unsaturated Equation Solver (DRUtES). The tutorials are in 1D for simplicity. We start with simple flow models such as heat conduction through a wall, followed by simple infiltration, then we move on to coupled models with examples covering coupled heat and water flow, and finally coupled water flow and contaminant transport.

\section{Software}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Install $DRUtES$. You can get $DRUtES$ from the github repository \href{https://github.com/michalkuraz/drutes-dev/} {drutes-dev} or download it from the \href{http://drutes.org/public/?core=account}{drutes.org} website. 
	\item Follow website instructions on \href{http://drutes.org/public/?core=account}{drutes.org} for the installation.
	\item Working R installation (optional, to generate plots you can execute freely distributed R script) 
	\item The branch \textit{tutorial} will work with all tutorials.  
\end{enumerate}
